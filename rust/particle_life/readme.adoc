= Particle Life Readme

The goal is to implement something inspired by particle life as seen https://www.ventrella.com/Clusters/[here]

== Outline
=== Particle Properties

* Position
* Velocity
* Colour
** This can be interpreted as a "species"

=== World Properties

* Cyclical
** Just don't want to deal with edge collision, not that it's a problem...
* Drag
** Represents entropy and prevents the systems forces from exploding
* Attraction Forces
** A Particle is either attracted or repelled by other Particles based on their distance and colour match up. This pairing is not symmetrical, meaning that in general stem:[F_{red->blue}] does not imply stem:[F_{blue->red}]
** Forces have a maximum range
** Colour based force is overwritten by a universal repelling force in proximity. This prevents collapsing to a single point.
